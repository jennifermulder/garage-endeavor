## Purpose
An e-commerce application catering to the needs of a recent/ frequent mover looking to buy/sell lightly used goods at a bargain. This platform is a virtual garage sale, allowing users from all over the capability to purchase and purge on a world-wide scale.

## Features
When the user loads the site, they are able to view a homepage with a functioning garage door revealing the options to buy or sell various products. 

When the user selects the buy option, they are presented with a collage of items that they can add to the shopping cart OR navigate to a desired category to view the products within that designation. When adding to the shopping cart, the cart will open and display the options to edit the quantity or checkout. Upon checkout, the user is redirected to a Stripe payment page to enter their information. The user is notified of successful payment completion and redirected back to the site to continue shopping! 

When the user selects the sell option, they are presented with an input form to add their product's, name, description, price, photo and other details. When the user submits the listing, they are they redirected to the main product page where they will see their newly posted product.

The user is able to track their activity by navigating to the User Profile page where they will see their posted and purchased items!
